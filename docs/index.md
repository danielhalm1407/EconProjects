# Econ Projects

A collection of pet/passion projects in economic and financial theory, policy and transit modelling.

#### Project 1: UBI_Test

- Modelling the Effect of a Universal Basic Income Transfer on Income Distribution Throughout time.

#### Project 2: [Investment_Theory](subpages_1\investment_theory.md)

- Predicting the returns of equities throughout time and attributing them to income and capital appreciation components.

- Predicting the returns of equities based on historic earnings growth, using a geometric series to predict the multiple the market will price in, and hence project price returns. Use this to create a rules-based 'select' index/rules based portfolio.

- **In future:** Aim to use past data to make prediction model stochastic: fit the distribution of the P/E multiple and in turn find the probability distribution of the (dependent) price returns.

- **In future:** Turn into a script that continuously queries the Bloomberg API and rebalances the portfolio. To do this monthly, likely need a cloud tool of some kind.

#### Project 3: Transit Fantasy

- Import existing Google MyMaps transit fantasy maps (as KML Files) and take them even further. Purely for fun.
